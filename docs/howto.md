# How to creat docs on ReadtheDocs?

You can follow the [offical getting started tutorial doc](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro/getting-started-with-mkdocs.html).
However you can creat a repo and files directly but not through the regular steps of [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/installation/).

## 1. Creat a repo and files (on Github)

Follow this structure,
```
mkdocs.yml    # The configuration file.
docs/
    index.md  # The documentation homepage.
    readthedocs.yaml  # ??
    requirements.txt  # the required packages
    ...       # Other markdown pages, images and other files.
```

## 2. Login your [ReadtheDocs](https://readthedocs.org/)

## 3. `Import a Project` then `Builds` 

## 4. Projects > `Admin` > Advanced Settings (Default settings)

!! Very important !!

Select Documentation type as <mark>Mkdocs</mark>
